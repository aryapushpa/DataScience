step1: Firstly User has to Load the image and 		analyze the image
step2: extract the features of an image
step3: now user done image preprocessing
step4: then convert image into gray scale and 		binary level
step5: Plot the two histograms 
	1.gray scale 2. binary level
step6: Now start the GLCM and enter the values 		in metrices 
step7: Run it and the user will get the output 	corresponding to the value like he will 	get some images which is divided in 	matrix sky and grass

step8: same as the user run the monofractal 	algorithm where the user calculating the 	Fractal dimentions of the binary image 	and find the lacunarity of the image 	wich is converted into binary and stored 	in the 2D array as matrix
step9: User apply the monofractal algorithm to 		fine the moment of order of the image
